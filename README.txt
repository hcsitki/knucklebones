KNUCKLEBONES
Hunter Sitki & Zac Wilson

We wanted to recreate the game of Knucklebones, a game that is a minigame in another video
game, Cult of the Lamb. 

Definitely one of the hardest parts of making this game was getting the correct bounding boxes on 
the canvas to register clicks correctly. This required a lot of trial and error and calculations to make
it work. Another hard part was programming the opponent's logic in such a way that it can beat you at
the game, but not every time. Having to figure out a hierarchy of precedence for the computer to choose
it's moves was difficult but cool to see once it worked. It makes for a game that does present an actual
challenge. It isn't just a free win, but you do have to apply some logic to it, and even when you do,
you can still get outplayed. 

We definitely learned a lot about how to use canvases and drawing. We decided to do stuff like drawing the
dice within our own code in order to help us understand what was going on with the canvas coordinate-grid
system. 

Overall, this was a cool project and I think we got an enjoyable game out of it.
